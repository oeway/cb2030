This notebook requires a GPU enabeled computer to execute. If you have one, please use this link to reach the [notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/statisticalbiotechnology/cb2030/blob/master/nb/vae/VAEofCarcinomas.ipynb).


Otherwise, please use the Google colab version of the notebook. It contains some more code, to get to run well on their cloud server, however, don't let that distract you.
